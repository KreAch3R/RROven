# RROven

Easily build RRO overlays!

## Instructions

1. **REQUIRED**: Android SDK with build-tools installed

2. Edit **buildoverlays.sh** script to modify some variables according to your Android SDK location and the build-tools version you want to use.

## TODO

1. Introduce a .cfg file instead of messing around with the script file
2. Automatically locate SDK - build tools version?
3. Include Substratum's specific AndroidManifest keys and values
4. Add a DEBUG argument for enablind/disabling the aapt verbose output
